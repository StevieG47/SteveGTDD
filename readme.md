## Installation

- Checkout the repo (and submodules)

##Notes and to do statement
The PID control method fuctions are  listed in details and it really help for other programmers. 
Todo:
The Kp, Ki, and Kd are given at first time and can't be changed. So it could be better if there is a function can set all three paramaters beforehead.
